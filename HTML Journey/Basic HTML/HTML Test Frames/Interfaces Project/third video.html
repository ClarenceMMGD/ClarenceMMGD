Crochet along with me to make yourself a fat squishy oversized amigurumi bumble bee - <br>
super simple and easy enough for even a beginner to make. <br><br>
Materials: <br>

Yarn in bumblebee colours! Yellow, black and white for the wings<br>

Scrap of pink and black yarn for the face<br>

Hook size: Smaller than your yarn recommends to keep your stitches tight<br>

10mm Safety Eyes<br>

Stitch Marker<br>

Large eye needle for weaving in ends and sewing wings to the body<br>
