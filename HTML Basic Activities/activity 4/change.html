<font face="Arial"  size=5px><p align=left><br>as the global challenges undermine our education, we should not let our quality education decay, or to dig its grave. <br>in such times like pandemic has struck us, we should not wait for the beast to sleep, we should take action to keep the flow of education running, in such cases
we have to find a way, a way in which we can overcome this situation, as long we stick together as a community, a way in which we need the most will appear infront of us in no time,
the decisions we make always consist of pro and cons which is inevitable or unavoidable, where quality education is undermined by certain of it, nevertheless, through times like this
we should consider some difficulties or issues, no matter what, we need to stay diligent, stay strong to ourselves and commit our duties as a student to make this year possible to learn like the usual days but in normal way, we have to stay adaptive to changes in our life, for that the quality education will be encouraged to our life aswell.
